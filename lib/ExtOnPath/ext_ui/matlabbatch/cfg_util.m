function varargout = cfg_util(cmd, varargin)

% This is the command line interface to the batch system. It manages the
% following structures:
% * Generic configuration structure c0. This structure will be initialised
%   to an cfg_repeat with empty .values list. Each application should
%   provide an application-specific master configuration file, which
%   describes the executable module(s) of an application and their inputs.
%   This configuration will be rooted directly under the master
%   configuration node. In this way, modules of different applications can
%   be combined with each other.
%   CAVE: the root nodes of each application must have an unique tag -
%   cfg_util will refuse to add an application which has a root tag that is
%   already used by another application.
% * Job specific configuration structure cj. This structure contains the
%   modules to be executed in a job, their input arguments and
%   dependencies between them. The layout of cj is not visible to the user.
% To address executable modules and their input values, cfg_util will
% return id(s) of unspecified type. If necessary, these id(s) should be
% stored in cell arrays in a calling application, since their internal
% format may change.
%
% The commands to manipulate these structures are described below in
% alphabetical order.
%
%  cfg_util('addapp', cfg[, def])
%
% Add an application to cfg_util. If cfg is a cfg_item, then it is used
% as initial configuration. Alternatively, if cfg is a MATLAB function,
% this function is evaluated. The return argument of this function must be
% a single variable containing the full configuration tree of the
% application to be batched.
% Optionally, a defaults configuration struct or function can be supplied.
% This function must return a single variable containing a (pseudo) job
% struct/cell array which holds defaults values for configuration items.
% These defaults should be rooted at the application's root node, not at
% the overall root node. They will be inserted by calling initialise on the
% application specific part of the configuration tree.
%
%  mod_job_id = cfg_util('addtojob', job_id, mod_cfg_id)
%
% Append module with id mod_cfg_id in the cfg tree to job with id
% job_id. Returns a mod_job_id, which can be passed on to other cfg_util
% callbacks that modify the module in the job.
%
%  [mod_job_idlist, new2old_id] = cfg_util('compactjob', job_id)
%
% Modifies the internal representation of a job by removing deleted modules
% from the job configuration tree. This will invalidate all mod_job_ids and
% generate a new mod_job_idlist.
% A translation table new2old_id is provided, where 
%  mod_job_idlist = old_mod_job_idlist{new2old_id}
% translates between an old id list and the compact new id list.
%
%  cfg_util('delfromjob', job_id, mod_job_id)
%
% Delete a module from a job.
%
%  cfg_util('deljob', job_id)
%
% Delete job with job_id from the job list. 
%
%  sts = cfg_util('filljob', job_id, input1, ..., inputN)
%  sts = cfg_util('filljobui', job_id, ui_fcn, input1, ..., inputN)
%
% Fill missing inputs in a job from a list of input items. If an can not be
% filled by the specified input, this input will be discarded. If
% cfg_util('filljobui'...) is called, [val sts] = ui_fcn(item) will be run
% and should return a value which is suitable for setval(item, val,
% false). sts should be set to true if input should continue with the
% next item. This can result in an partially filled job. If ui_fcn is
% interrupted, the job will stay unfilled.
% If cfg_util('filljob'...) is called, the current job can become partially
% filled.
% Returns the all_set status of the filled job, returns always false if
% ui_fcn is interrupted.
%
%  cfg_util('gencode', fname, apptag|cfg_id[, tropts])
%
% Generate code from default configuration structure, suitable for
% recreating the tree structure. Note that function handles may not be
% saved properly. By default, the entire tree is saved into a file fname.
% If tropts is given as a traversal option specification, code generation
% will be split at the nodes matching tropts.stopspec. Each of these nodes will
% generate code in a new file with filename <fname>_<tag of node>, and the
% nodes up to tropts.stopspec will be saved into fname.
% If a file named <fname>_mlb_preamble.m exists in the folder where the
% configuration code is being written, it will be read in literally
% and its contents will be prepended to each of the created files. This
% allows to automatically include e.g. copyright or revision.
%
%  outputs = cfg_util('getAllOutputs', job_id)
% 
% outputs - cell array with module outputs. If a module has not yet been
%           run, a cfg_inv_out object is returned.
%
%  voutputs = cfg_util('getAllVOutputs', job_id)
% 
% voutputs - cell array with virtual output descriptions (cfg_dep objects).
%            These describe the structure of the job outputs. To create
%            dependencies, they can be entered into matching input objects
%            in subsequent modules of the same job.
%
%  [tag, val] = cfg_util('harvest', job_id[, mod_job_id])
%
% Harvest is a method defined for all 'cfg_item' objects. It collects the
% entered values and dependencies of the input items in the tree and
% assembles them in a struct/cell array.
% If no mod_job_id is supplied, the internal configuration tree will be
% cleaned up before harvesting. Dependencies will not be resolved in this
% case. The internal state of cfg_util is not modified in this case. The
% structure returned in val may be saved to disk as a job and can be loaded
% back into cfg_util using the 'initjob' command.
% If a mod_job_id is supplied, only the relevant part of the configuration
% tree is harvested, dependencies are resolved and the internal state of
% cfg_util is updated. In this case, the val output is only part of a job
% description and can not be loaded back into cfg_util.
%
%  [tag, appdef] = cfg_util('harvestdef'[, apptag|cfg_id])
%
% Harvest the defaults branches of the current configuration tree. If
% apptag is supplied, only the subtree of that application whose root tag
% matches apptag/whose id matches cfg_id is harvested. In this case,
% appdef is a struct/cell array that can be supplied as a second argument
% in application initialisation by cfg_util('addapp', appcfg,
% appdef). 
% If no application is specified, defaults of all applications will be
% returned in one struct/cell array. 
% 
%  [tag, val] = cfg_util('harvestrun', job_id)
%
% Harvest data of a job that has been (maybe partially) run, resolving
% all dependencies that can be resolved. This can be used to document
% what has actually been done in a job and which inputs were passed to
% modules with dependencies.
% If the job has not been run yet, tag and val will be empty.
%
%  doc = cfg_util('showdoc', tagstr|cfg_id|(job_id, mod_job_id[, item_mod_id]))
%
% Return help text for specified item. Item can be either a tag string or
% a cfg_id in the default configuration tree, or a combination of job_id,
% mod_job_id and item_mod_id from the current job.
% The text returned will be a cell array of strings, each string
% containing one paragraph of the help text.
%
%  cfg_util('initcfg')
%
% Initialise cfg_util configuration. All currently added applications and
% jobs will be cleared.
% Initial application data will be initialised to a combination of
% cfg_mlbatch_appcfg.m files in their order found on the MATLAB path. Each
% of these config files should be a function with calling syntax
%   function [cfg, def] = cfg_mlbatch_appcfg(varargin) 
% This function should do application initialisation (e.g. add
% paths). cfg and def should be configuration and defaults data
% structures or the name of m-files on the MATLAB path containing these
% structures. If no defaults are provided, the second output argument
% should be empty.
% cfg_mlbatch_appcfg files are executed in the order they are found on
% the MATLAB path with the one first found taking precedence over
% following ones.
%
%  cfg_util('initdef', apptag|cfg_id[, defvar])
%
% Set default values for application specified by apptag or
% cfg_id. If defvar is supplied, it should be any representation of a
% defaults job as returned by cfg_util('harvestdef', apptag|cfg_id),
% i.e. a MATLAB variable, a function creating this variable...
% Defaults from defvar are overridden by defaults specified in .def
% fields.
% New defaults only apply to modules added to a job after the defaults
% have been loaded. Saved jobs and modules already present in the current
% job will not be changed.
%
%  [job_id, mod_job_idlist] = cfg_util('initjob'[, job])
%
% Initialise a new job. 
% If job is given as input argument, the job tree structure will be
% loaded with data from the struct/cell array job and a cell list of job
% ids will be returned. Otherwise, a new job without modules will be
% created.
% The new job will be appended to an internal list of jobs. It must
% always be referenced by its job_id.
%
%  sts = cfg_util('isjob_id', job_id)
%  sts = cfg_util('ismod_cfg_id', mod_cfg_id)
%  sts = cfg_util('ismod_job_id', job_id, mod_job_id)
%  sts = cfg_util('isitem_mod_id', item_mod_id)
% Test whether the supplied id seems to be of the queried type. Returns
% true if the id matches the data format of the queried id type, false
% otherwise. For item_mod_ids, no checks are performed whether the id is
% really valid (i.e. points to an item in the configuration
% structure). This can be used to decide whether 'list*' or 'tag2*'
% callbacks returned valid ids.
%
%  [mod_cfg_idlist, stop, [contents]] = cfg_util('listcfg[all]', mod_cfg_id, find_spec[, fieldnames])
%
% List modules and retrieve their contents in the cfg tree, starting at
% mod_cfg_id. If mod_cfg_id is empty, search will start at the root level
% of the tree. The returned mod_cfg_id_list is always relative to the root
% level of the tree, not to the mod_cfg_id of the start item. This search
% is designed to stop at cfg_exbranch level. Its behaviour is undefined if
% mod_cfg_id points to an item within an cfg_exbranch. See 'match' and
% 'cfg_item/find' for details how to specify find_spec. A cell list of
% matching modules is returned.
% If the 'all' version of this command is used, also matching
% non-cfg_exbranch items up to the first cfg_exbranch are returned. This
% can be used to build a menu system to manipulate configuration.
% If a cell array of fieldnames is given, contents of the specified fields
% will be returned. See 'cfg_item/list' for details. This callback is not
% very specific in its search scope. To find a cfg_item based on the
% sequence of tags of its parent items, use cfg_util('tag2mod_cfg_id',
% tagstring) instead.
%
%  [item_mod_idlist, stop, [contents]] = cfg_util('listmod', job_id, mod_job_id, item_mod_id, find_spec[, tropts][, fieldnames])
%  [item_mod_idlist, stop, [contents]] = cfg_util('listmod', mod_cfg_id, item_mod_id, find_spec[, tropts][, fieldnames])
%
% Find configuration items starting in module mod_job_id in the job
% referenced by job_id or in module mod_cfg_id in the defaults tree,
% starting at item item_mod_id. If item_mod_id is an empty array, start
% at the root of a module. By default, search scope are the filled items
% of a module. See 'match' and 'cfg_item/find' for details how to specify
% find_spec and tropts and how to search the default items instead of the
% filled ones. A cell list of matching items is returned.
% If a cell array of fieldnames is given, contents of the specified fields
% will be returned. See 'cfg_item/list' for details.
%
%  sts = cfg_util('match', job_id, mod_job_id, item_mod_id, find_spec)
%
% Returns true if the specified item matches the given find spec and false
% otherwise. An empty item_mod_id means that the module node itself should
% be matched.
%
%  new_mod_job_id = cfg_util('replicate', job_id, mod_job_id[, item_mod_id, val])
%
% If no item_mod_id is given, replicate a module by appending it to the
% end of the job with id job_id. The values of all items will be
% copied. This is in contrast to 'addtojob', where a module is added with
% default settings. Dependencies where this module is a target will be
% kept, whereas source dependencies will be dropped from the copied module.
% If item_mod_id points to a cfg_repeat object within a module, its
% setval method is called with val. To achieve replication, val(1) must
% be finite and negative, and val(2) must be the index into item.val that
% should be replicated. All values are copied to the replicated entry.
%
%  cfg_util('run'[, job|job_id])
%
% Run the currently configured job. If job is supplied as argument and is
% a harvested job, then cfg_util('initjob', job) will be called first. If
% job_id is supplied and is a valid job_id, the job with this job id will
% be run.
% The job is harvested and dependencies are resolved if possible.
% If cfg_get_defaults('cfg_util.runparallel') returns true, all
% modules without unresolved dependencies will be run in arbitrary order.
% Then the remaining modules are harvested again and run, if their
% dependencies can be resolved. This process is iterated until no modules
% are left or no more dependencies can resolved. In a future release,
% independent modules may run in parallel, if there are licenses to the
% Distributed Computing Toolbox available.
% Note that this requires dependencies between modules to be described by
% cfg_dep objects. If a module e.g. relies on file output of another module
% and this output is already specified as a filename of a non-existent
% file, then the dependent module may be run before the file is created.
% Side effects (changes in global variables, working directories) are
% currently not modeled by dependencies.
% If a module fails to execute, computation will continue on modules that
% do not depend on this module. An error message will be logged and the
% module will be reported as 'failed to run' in the MATLAB command window.
%
%  cfg_util('runserial'[, job|job_id])
%
% Like 'run', but force cfg_util to run the job as if each module was
% dependent on its predecessor. If cfg_get_defaults('cfg_util.runparallel')
% returns false, cfg_util('run',...) and cfg_util('runserial',...) are
% identical.
%
%  cfg_util('savejob', job_id, filename)
%
% The current job will be save to the .m file specified by filename. This
% .m file contains MATLAB script code to recreate the job variable. It is
% based on gencode (part of this MATLAB batch system) for all standard
% MATLAB types. For objects to be supported, they must implement their own
% gencode method.
%
%  cfg_util('savejobrun', job_id, filename)
%
% Save job after it has been run, resolving dependencies (see
% cfg_util('harvestrun',...)). If the job has not been run yet, nothing
% will be saved.
%
%  sts = cfg_util('setval', job_id, mod_job_id, item_mod_id, val)
%
% Set the value of item item_mod_id in module mod_job_id to val. If item is
% a cfg_choice, cfg_repeat or cfg_menu and val is numeric, the value will
% be set to item.values{val(1)}. If item is a cfg_repeat and val is a
% 2-vector, then the min(val(2),numel(item.val)+1)-th value will be set
% (i.e. a repeat added or replaced). If val is an empty cell, the value of
% item will be cleared.
% sts returns the status of all_set_item after the value has been
% set. This can be used to check whether the item has been successfully
% set.
% Once editing of a module has finished, the module needs to be harvested
% in order to update dependencies from and to other modules.
%
%  cfg_util('setdef', mod_cfg_id, item_mod_id, val)
% 
% Like cfg_util('setval',...) but set items in the defaults tree. This is
% only supported for cfg_leaf items, not for cfg_choice, cfg_repeat,
% cfg_branch items.
% Defaults only apply to new jobs, not to already configured ones.
%
%  doc = cfg_util('showdoc', tagstr|cfg_id|(job_id, mod_job_id[, item_mod_id]))
%
% Return help text for specified item. Item can be either a tag string or
% a cfg_id in the default configuration tree, or a combination of job_id,
% mod_job_id and item_mod_id from the current job.
% The text returned will be a cell array of strings, each string
% containing one paragraph of the help text. In addition to the help
% text, hints about valid values, defaults etc. are displayed.
%
%  doc = cfg_util('showdocwidth', handle|width, tagstr|cfg_id|(job_id, mod_job_id[, item_mod_id]))
%
% Same as cfg_util('showdoc', but use handle or width to determine the
% width of the returned strings.
%
%  [mod_job_idlist, str, sts, dep sout] = cfg_util('showjob', job_id[, mod_job_idlist])
%
% Return information about the current job (or the part referenced by the
% input cell array mod_job_idlist). Output arguments
% * mod_job_idlist - cell list of module ids (same as input, if provided)
% * str            - cell string of names of modules 
% * sts            - array of all set status of modules
% * dep            - array of dependency status of modules
% * sout           - array of output description structures 
% Each module configuration may provide a callback function 'vout' that
% returns a struct describing module output variables. See 'cfg_exbranch'
% for details about this callback, output description and output structure.
% The module needs to be harvested before to make output_struct available.
% This information can be used by the calling application to construct a
% dependency object which can be passed as input to other modules. See
% 'cfg_dep' for details about dependency objects.
%
%  [mod_cfg_id, item_mod_id] = cfg_util('tag2cfg_id', tagstr)
%
% Return a mod_cfg_id for the cfg_exbranch item that is the parent to the
% item in the configuration tree whose parents have tag names as in the
% dot-delimited tag string. item_mod_id is relative to the cfg_exbranch
% parent. If tag string matches a node above cfg_exbranch level, then
% item_mod_id will be invalid and mod_cfg_id will point to the specified
% node.
% Use cfg_util('ismod_cfg_id') and cfg_util('isitem_mod_id') to determine
% whether returned ids are valid or not.
% Tag strings should begin at the root level of an application configuration, 
% not at the matlabbatch root level.
%
%  mod_cfg_id = cfg_util('tag2mod_cfg_id', tagstr)
%
% Same as cfg_util('tag2cfg_id', tagstr), but it only returns a proper
% mod_cfg_id. If none of the tags in tagstr point to a cfg_exbranch, then
% mod_cfg_id will be invalid.
%
% The layout of the configuration tree and the types of configuration items
% have been kept compatible to a configuration system and job manager
% implementation in SPM5 (Statistical Parametric Mapping, Copyright (C)
% 2005 Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience). This code has been
% completely rewritten based on an object oriented model of the
% configuration tree.
%
% This code is part of a batch job configuration system for MATLAB. See 
%      help matlabbatch
% for a general overview.
